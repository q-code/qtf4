There are three types of forum: <b><i>Visible (public)</i></b> where subjects are visible by the board community, <b><i>Visible (private)</i></b> where a user will see only his own subjects, and <b><i>Hidden</i></b> meaning that the forum is for the moderators and administrators only. When you turn the status of a forum to <b><i>Frozen</i></b>, posting will not be possible (except for moderators).
