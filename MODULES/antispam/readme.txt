INSTALL A MODULE:
To install a module copy (ftp) the qtfm_*.php files into the application root folder ( ex: .../www/quicktalk/ )

WARNING:
DO NOT COPY the /language/ folders, as that can replace existing files and structure.
Instead, you must move the files from the module/language/ folders into the existing /language/ folders.

If the module includes an other sub-folder, copy it in the application root folder
